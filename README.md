# The Origins Project
_Food Provenance powered by Blockchain_  
**by Nick A, Samuel B & Richard J**

## Introduction
The Origins Project is a platform for crowd-sourcing the verification of claims made by food producers. TOP combines an NLP interface with a public blockchain to allow food producers to register claims about properties of their products (such as Made in NYC) and for others to attest to the validity of these claims. Consumers can then follow sources of attestation that they trust and ask TOP to verify the claims made by any product they encounter while they are shopping.
